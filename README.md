# Cavity-Detection
This is a binary classification project, it tells is tooth cavity affected or it is healthy. Dataset was created by myself with the help of dentist.
I have done cavity Detection project using CNN and Random Forest for compersion. 
As the size of the dataset is very less, misclassification of the tooth occurs when classification is done using CNN algorithm, even though I have image augmentation technique.
